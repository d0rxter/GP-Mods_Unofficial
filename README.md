# GP-Mods Right-to-Left

This right-to-left GP mod aims to give a more natural user experience for Arabic language users. It is still a work in progress.

For the original mod, please check https://github.com/jhmaloney/GP-Mods 

## Based on GP...

To avoid potential confusion with the original GP, which is used by students and educators
around the world, your mod should be named something other than simply "GP" or "GP Blocks,
and it should avoid displaying the original GP logo. You are  welcome to use the "GP Mod"
logo and encouraged to use the phrase "Based on GP" in your mod's title or about box.
